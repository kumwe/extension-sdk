/**
 * Byte-stable JSON encoder that every business-definition checksum and document comparison runs through.
 *
 * A published definition version is immutable and identified by a SHA-256 over these bytes, and package
 * synchronization decides whether a declaration changed by comparing a stored checksum against a freshly
 * encoded one. Those comparisons cross processes and outlive the request that made them, so the encoding
 * cannot depend on the order keys happen to sit in: string-keyed arrays are sorted, while lists keep
 * their positions because order carries meaning there. The accepted value space is deliberately narrow —
 * floats, resources, and objects are refused outright rather than digested into something that will not
 * reproduce — and nesting depth and collection size are bounded so a definition cannot carry unbounded
 * structure into the checksum. `FieldDefinition` calls `encode()` purely for that rejection, proving a
 * default, a configuration map, or a validator is representable before it is allowed into a definition,
 * and `Expression` measures the encoded length against its own byte budget.
