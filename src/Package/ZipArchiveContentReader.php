/**
 * Streams an extension archive's entries through ext/zip, one expanded entry at a time.
 *
 * This is the shipped `ArchiveContentReader` binding and the only place install-time admission expands
 * packaged bytes. Every entry is held to the per-entry ceiling the safety policy budgets for, and the
 * ceiling is enforced against the bytes that actually come out of the decompressor rather than against
 * the size the central directory claims, so a header that under-reports an entry cannot make the
 * process expand more than was budgeted. An entry whose expanded length disagrees with its declared
 * size is refused rather than yielded, because a truncated or over-long read describes an archive that
 * no longer matches its own index. The archive handle and every entry stream are closed on all paths,
 * including an abandoned iteration.
 *
 * Entries are pulled through a stream in fixed chunks rather than requested as one ceiling-sized read.
 * `ZipArchive::getFromIndex()` allocates the full length it is asked for and never releases the slack
 * once the entry turns out to be smaller, so asking for the ceiling cost the ceiling for every entry —
 * and for as long as the caller retained one. Admission retains two entries by design, the bill of
 * materials and the provenance statement, which pinned three ceilings' worth of buffers at once and
 * exhausted the deployed memory limit part-way through a perfectly ordinary package. Chunked reads
 * make the cost track the bytes an entry really has while leaving the ceiling exactly where it was.
 *
