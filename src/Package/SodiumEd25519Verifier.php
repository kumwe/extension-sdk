 * Verifies package signatures with libsodium's Ed25519 against a fixed set of configured public keys.
 *
 * This is the `PackageSignatureVerifier` for installations whose trusted keys come from configuration
 * rather than from the administered trust store — `TrustKeySignatureVerifier` is the sibling that reads
 * the database. Keys are decoded and length-checked once, in the constructor, so a mistyped
 * configuration value fails where the verifier is assembled instead of halfway through an install; after
 * that a verification is a map lookup and a single `sodium_crypto_sign_verify_detached` call. An
 * unrecognised key identifier is reported as a failed verification rather than as an error, because
 * whether a key should have been known is `PackageTrustPolicy`'s decision and not this adapter's.
