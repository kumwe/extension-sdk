 * How strictly install-time admission treats the static conformance scan of packaged code.

 * them. `Enforce` is the shipped default and the only posture a production deployment may run under,
 * because a package whose PHP does not parse, or whose manifest names files it does not carry, is
 * broken in a way that only becomes visible after it has been unpacked and loaded. `Warn` exists for
 * an installation carrying legacy packages that have not been rebuilt yet: the same findings are
 * recorded and surfaced, but they do not refuse the install. `Off` skips the scan entirely and is
 * refused under production rules, so the mode cannot become the silent bypass the signature flag once
 * was.
