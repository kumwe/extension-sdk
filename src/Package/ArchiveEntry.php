 * One row of an extension archive's directory: what an entry is, where it sits, and how large it claims
 * to be.
 *
 * An `ArchiveReader` builds these from the archive's header alone, without expanding anything, so
 * `PackageSafetyPolicy` can reject a decompression bomb, a symbolic link or a case-colliding path while
 * none of the package's bytes have touched the filesystem. The sizes are therefore the archive's own
 * claims and are not evidence about the eventual output — treating them as budgets to enforce is the
 * point, and trusting them as facts is not.
 *
 * The constructor refuses a negative size and a directory that claims payload bytes, so no limit check
 * downstream has to weigh a negative budget or a directory that reads like a file.
