/**
 * The admission gate that reads a package's own code and attestations before anything is unpacked.
 *
 * Installation already refused unsafe archives, non-strict manifests and untrusted signatures. What it
 * never did was look at the packaged PHP, even though the SDK has scanned it since the SDK existed, so
 * a signed package could carry code that has never been parsed by anything until the moment its
 * provider was resolved on a live site. This closes that, and it does it in one bounded pass: entries
 * are expanded one at a time through `ArchiveContentReader`, digested for the bill of materials, and
 * checked by `PackageCodeConformance` — the same checks the SDK reports, so the two answers agree.
 *
 * Two failure semantics meet here and they are deliberately different.
 *
 * Attestations fail closed regardless of mode. `kumwe.sbom.json` and `kumwe.provenance.json` travel
 * inside the package bytes the publisher's signature covers, so a document that is present and does
 * not reconcile is not a warning about code quality — it is a package whose contents disagree with
 * what its own builder recorded, and it is refused. A package carrying neither document is recorded as
 * `Absent` and admitted, because packages built before attestations shipped must keep installing; the
 * Extensions screen shows the difference so an operator can tell an old package from a described one.
 *
 * Code conformance fails according to `PackageConformanceMode`, and only two findings are ever
 * blocking: PHP that does not parse, and a manifest naming a class, asset or template the package does
 * not carry. Both describe a package that is already broken and whose breakage would otherwise surface
 * as a fatal error on a live request after publication. Everything else the scan can find — a missing
 * `strict_types` declaration, an unresolved authoring marker, an absent README — is recorded as
 * advisory, because refusing a third-party package over house style would be a policy this project has
 * no standing to enforce on other people's code.
