 * Port that streams an extension archive's file contents without writing any of them to disk.

 * `ArchiveReader` answers what an archive claims to contain; this answers what it actually contains,
 * and it exists because install-time admission has to read packaged bytes before extraction rather
 * than after it. Nothing an implementation yields has touched the filesystem, so a package refused by
 * `PackageAdmissionScanner` leaves no tree behind to clean up. Reading is deliberately separate from
 * listing: the safety policy must have accepted the entry table, and therefore the per-entry and total
 * expansion budgets, before a single entry is expanded through this port.
 *
 * @since  0.1.0
