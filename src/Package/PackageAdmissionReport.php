/**
 * Everything install-time admission established about a package, in the form an operator later reads.
 *
 * The report exists because a supply-chain control nobody can see is a control nobody can act on. It
 * is written to the release row it belongs to, summarised into the `extension.install` audit record,
 * and rendered on the Extensions screen, so the question "what is inside this extension, where does it
 * claim to come from, and what did we check" has one answer that outlives the install command's
 * output. A refused install produces no report — the exception is the report — which is why every
 * instance of this class describes a package that was admitted.
