 * than the host container, so an extension reaches exactly the services the runtime chose to pass it,
 * plus the ones it registered itself. An implementation owes two guarantees: an identifier that was
 * never granted fails instead of resolving, and a factory the extension registers cannot take over the
 * name of a service it was handed. `RestrictedExtensionContainer` is the implementation the runtime
 * builds, one per active extension. This is an API compatibility boundary, not a security sandbox — it
 * bounds what trusted in-process extension code can reach, not what hostile code could do. See
 * `docs/architecture/extensions.md` for the ambient authority admitted code inherits regardless.
