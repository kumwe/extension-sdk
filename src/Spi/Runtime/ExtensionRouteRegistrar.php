/**
 * Route-declaration surface an extension is handed while the HTTP application is being composed.

 * An extension declares its routes through this contract instead of touching the router, which is what
 * makes the declarations containable: an implementation is bound to one extension and keeps every route
 * it accepts inside that extension's path and route-name namespace, so no extension can shadow a core
 * path or claim another extension's route name. Routes are declared once at composition and are never
 * withdrawn, so an implementation is also expected to make each route revocable per request rather than
 * at registration time. `MezzioExtensionRouteRegistrar` is what the runtime passes to
 * `RuntimeExtension::registerRoutes()`.
