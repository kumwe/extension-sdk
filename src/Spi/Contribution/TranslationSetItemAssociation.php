/**
 * The versioned claim that one stored content item belongs to a package's declared translation set.
 *
 * `TranslationGroupDeclaration` is admission metadata: it says which sets a package will publish and in
 * which languages, and it is signed before any of the package's code runs. What it deliberately does
 * not carry is a runtime item identifier, because content entries only come into existence after
 * install. This type is the other half — the additive generation-one contract a package hands to
 * `ContentService::translateContributed()` to place one of its stored entries into a declared set. It
 * is a new type beside the frozen declaration rather than a reinterpretation of it, so every package
 * admitted against the declaration-only contract keeps exactly the bytes and behaviour it was admitted
 * with.
 *
 * The association is deliberately closed at both ends. It names its owner and the declared set, and the
 * set identifier must sit inside that owner's namespace, so a package cannot claim another package's
 * set by spelling its identifier. Core then resolves the pair against the active contribution registry
 * before anything is stored, which is where an undeclared set, a withdrawn package or an undeclared
 * locale is refused.
 *
 * The runtime translation group is derived rather than allocated: one name-based UUID per generation,
 * site, owner and set. That derivation is part of the frozen generation-one promise — the same
 * association resolves to the same group across requests, restarts and reinstalls, which is what makes
 * the stored `translation_group_id` on each entry a durable link back to the declaring package without
 * a second storage surface. A future generation may derive differently; generation one may not change.
 *
