/**
 * Additive capability for packages that contribute to the visual composition surface.
 *
 * This interface is separate from the frozen contribution SPI registrars so every existing provider
 * stays source compatible: a package that composes nothing never sees it, and one that declares blocks,
 * patterns, field controls, inspectors, design vocabulary or composition migrations requires this
 * capability explicitly before those declarations are reconciled. The concrete owner-bound registrar
 * implements it alongside the others, so an extension declares its composition surface through exactly
 * the path it declares capabilities, routes and business definitions through.
 *
 * It exists because the composition contribution contract is frozen at Gate A while the surface that
 * consumes it is Gate B, per decision D16: everything registered here is declarative and inert, held to
 * the signed manifest at admission and at install, and consumed by nothing until the surface ships.
